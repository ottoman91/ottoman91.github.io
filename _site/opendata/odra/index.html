<p class="text-center"><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Ever since constitutional government was restored in 2006 and peace 
consolidated at the end of the civil war, Liberia has made commendable progress 
in the realm of open government. With the establishing of institutions such as 
the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission and the Liberia Extractive Industries 
and Transparency Initiative (LEITI), the Government of Liberia (GoL) has showcased a 
strong commitment to fostering an open and peaceful society.</p>

<p>However, the country has lagged in terms of embracing a culture of open data, 
in which government data is shared in open format among government and non-government 
stakeholders for increased efficiency, accountability, and economic development.
Unleashing the potential of open data could have transformative effects on the 
country’s employment rate, fiscal situation, and levels of poverty.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Open Data Readiness Assessment</strong></p>

<p>The World Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning(MFDP) and the Independent Information Commissioner (IIC), conducted 
the Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) for GoL. <a href="http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/odra.html" target="_blank">ODRA</a> 
is a methodological tool developed by the Bank that is used to conduct an 
action-oriented assessment of the readiness of a government or individual 
agency to evaluate, design and implement an open data initiative. The tool is 
organized around the following 8 pillars:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Senior Leadership</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policy/Legal Framework</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Institutions &amp; Capacities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demand for Open Data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Civic Engagement and Capability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Infrastructure</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Activities Conducted Under ODRA</strong></p>

<p>The following activities were conducted as part of ODRA</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Acquired knowledge about the open data ecosystem in Liberia, with particular 
focus on the activities of key stakeholders in the private sector.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interviewed a range of different stakeholders at GoL, along with representatives 
from the civil society, media, and the private sector to understand the unique 
challenges that Liberia faces in launching a nationwide open data initiative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developed and recommended a year long action plan that GoL can take to 
implement a nationwide open data initiative that adheres to their requirements.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Benefits of a Properly Implemented Open Data Initiative</strong></p>

<p>Some of the major long term benefits that are a by-product of any 
successfully implemented open data initiative are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Opening the doors for long term development projects.</em> By not only 
improving the data collection processes across the major economy-driving 
sectors, but also by making this information easily accessible to the public, 
the government makes it easy for both development agencies as well as the 
private sector to make data driven investment decisions on projects that have 
the potential to create long lasting economic impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Capacity building of government agencies and departments.</em> 
A major challenge that post-conflict countries face in the adoption of digital 
services is the capacity of essential government ministries to properly take 
advantage of technology. Due to a combination of both a weak education system 
as well as a lack of exposure to technology, most government employees are 
uncomfortable with adopting technology in their every day work. A nationwide 
open data initiative can provide the necessary impetus to enhance the 
technological capacity of government agencies and departments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Strengthening of democratic institutions.</em> The key element for any strong 
and vibrant democracy is the free-flow of accurate information from the 
government to its citizens. Keeping in mind the information asymmetries that 
are inherently present in post conflict countries due to weak institutions, it 
is vital that the democratic process is strengthened by making it easier for 
the public to get hold of information regarding the various activities of the 
government which, by law, are to be made publicly available. An open data 
initiative would help in this regard, since the program would encourage 
proactive disclosure of public information by the government, thereby 
enhancing the people’s trust in the activities of their elected representatives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Allowing the government to effectively communicate with its citizenry.</em> 
An inherent assumption that a lot of people make about the performance of 
governments in post conflict zones is that they do not have the people’s best 
intentions at heart.<br />
Although it is true that quite often, the performance of governments in these 
regions is severely lacking, it is important to appreciate the scope of the 
issues that exist on the ground, which would severely challenge the capacity 
of any government. A properly implemented open data 
initiative would help in providing a more accurate picture of the ground 
reality to all stakeholders and to the extent to which their representatives 
have been tackling the issues.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Challenges With Implementing an Open Data Initiative in West Africa</strong></p>

<p>However, it is essential that if an Open Data initiative is to be made 
sustainable and not just limited to another short term development slogan, the 
current modus operandi of how these initiatives are administered needs to be 
revised. The following are some suggestions on how to restructure the 
conversations around Open Data in Post Conflict countries.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Revise the base assumptions that are made in evaluating the feasibility of 
an open data initiative.</em> The current literature and assessment tools that are 
used for evaluating the capacity of various agencies are not properly attuned 
with the on-ground realities that exist in post conflict countries. With 
current data management processes being virtually non-existent coupled with 
very low tech skills of the end users, it is important to appreciate the low 
hanging fruit, especially the simplest, most “non-tech” solutions that can be 
implemented for addressing some of the challenges. Case in point: smartphone 
usage might be raging across the world and even in some East African countries, 
but in the context of Liberia and Sierra Leone, the majority of end users still 
use feature phones, quite often only for making and receiving calls. Therefore, 
any tech initiative should take into account these basic channels for delivering 
services to the end users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Incentivize the local stakeholders to buy-into the initiative.</em> 
Quite often, a well intended development initiative fails to take off since it
does not have the necessary support from the major stakeholders and end users. 
With the open data movement, care should be taken to ensure that it is not 
seen as an initiative that does not have sufficient evangelists from the 
on-ground implementers. Donor fatigue is a major reason as to why a number of 
heavily backed initiatives have failed to take root in West Africa, and care
needs to be taken to ensure that the open data movement does not follow this 
tried-and-tested trajectory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Rephrase the conversation around “accountability” and open data to make 
it more inclusive.</em> A critical consideration to make in running an open data 
initiative is that it would often require working in tandem with institutions 
and departments who might not be too enthusiastic on the added public scrutiny 
that the initiative would bring on them. It is also important to understand 
that these same institutions also hold the power to substantially slow down 
the implementation of the initiative. In order to mitigate this problem, care 
needs to be taken in ensuring that the open data initiative does not come 
across as an accountability ‘witch hunt’ against specific individuals, but 
rather, is an exercise being undertaken to improve the efficiency of the entire
government machinery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Disseminate awareness on what Open Data really encapsulates.</em> There is a 
widespread misunderstanding that an open data initiative would entail all 
information collected by government agencies to be disclosed to the general 
public. Not only is this idea wrong, but it also endangers support to the 
initiative from other stakeholders who often balk at this seemingly little 
regard for privacy or protection of critical information. Therefore, it is 
important to properly define what open data really means, and that it only 
entails the proper documentation, digitization and dissemination of information
which by law is to be disclosed and made publicly available.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>The first version of the ODRA Report for GoL has been drafted, and it is currently
being reviewed internally by the World Bank. The report is expected to be launched
in early 2018.</p>
