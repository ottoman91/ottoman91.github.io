        <p><em>This post outlines the pilot and proof of concept study that was conducted for an infectious disease
surveillance and community response system developed for all public health units
in the district of Port Loko in Sierra Leone. The platform was developed by
IBM Research Africa for the USAID <a href="http://www.ebolagrandchallenge.net/innovations-3/" target="_blank">Ebola Grant Challenge</a></em></p>

<p><em>This project was implemented while I was working as the Research and Developer
 lead at <a href="https://idtlabs.xyz" target="_blank">iDT Labs</a>. For further information about this
 project please email info@idtlabs.xyz</em></p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Context</strong></p>

<p>The Ebola outbreak of 2014 in Sierra Leone highlighted how there was an absence
of a proper mechanism between the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) and
its partner organizations for the sharing of important datasets that were
imperative to understanding and fighting the spread of the epidemic. Instead,
these datasets were often constrained in their silos, leading to extreme
inefficiencies in the collection and analysis of critical health data, which
had a negative impact that permeated downstream to the frontline response to
the epidemic.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>The Epidemic Preparedness in Communities (EPiC) platform was built by IBM
Research Africa to support heath sector stakeholders with data-driven tools for
aiding evidence-based decision making during the post-Ebola recovery efforts
in the healthcare sector in Sierra Leone. By leveraging a data-driven platform
that provided strong data analytics and visualisation tools from a single,
intuitive dashboard, the aim of EPiC was to help the MoHS, along
with the other stakeholders and partners to utilise a data-driven process of
tracking and preventing the spread of infectious diseases in their communities.</p>

<p>The platform aimed at enabling health administrators to quickly identify which
health facilities and regions required urgent assistance using both formal
health management records and community feedback.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Scope of the Pilot</strong></p>

<p>iDT Labs was contracted by IBM Research Africa to implement a one month proof
of concept exercise at the offices of the district health medical team at Port
Loko and the Open Government Initiative (OGI) at Freetown to conduct the following
activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Map out the technical capacity for all organizations and users in the
stakeholder group, including infrastructure (hardware and connectivity),
systems (the current health information systems in place) and human resource
capacity (technical abilities of potential users).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide training for the initial users of EPiC during the proof of concept
phase</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Map out the current workflows for the use of data in disease surveillance in
Sierra Leone to form baseline for the Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) assessment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="text-center"><strong>The Methodology</strong></p>

<p>The following officers from the DHMT at Port Loko participated in the pilot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>District medical officer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data analysts supporting the district medical officer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infectious disease and health surveillance officers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitoring and evaluation officers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the pilot training at the DHMT was to help participants
understand the system and how data driven surveillance and interventions could
lead to substantial efficiency gains. The training was also divided into
three main portions that were designed to transition the users through the
following three stages</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Data Flow of the System</strong></p>

<p>The following diagrammatic representation mapped out how the existing data
flows would ideally integrate with the disease surveillance and community
response dashboards of EPiC.</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Key Insights From the Pilot</strong></p>

<p>The following were they key insights that were gained from the pilot, which
are relevant for any data driven initiative that is aimed at improving the
service delivery of a critical public sector entity in a post conflict economy such
as that of Sierra Leone.</p>

<p><strong>1.Data visualization and intelligence is the end product of a value chain
that involves several pre-requisite activities, and any data visualization tool
should support this entire value chain</strong></p>

<p>Although the data intelligence and visualisation functionalities related to
disease surveillance would greatly help any under funded national health unit,
data visualisation is in fact a minor component in the chain of activities
carried out by surveillance officers. The system should have provided the users with
functionalities for directly uploading, verifying and sharing the raw data that
was used by the platform to generate intelligence and reports.</p>

<p><strong>2.A strong stakeholder engagement strategy is critical for the successful
adoption of any technological intervention in the public sector</strong></p>

<p>For the successful, eventual roll out of any national disease surveillance system
, stakeholder buy-in is of utmost importance. Over the course of the trainings
conducted at the DHMT, low priority was afforded to the exercise by the top
management of the DHMT, with individuals dedicated to the exercise
being low-level employees with limited understanding of the entire value chain
of infectious disease surveillance that EPIC aimed to support.Given the alarming
rate of failed technological interventions in post conflict countries such as
Sierra Leone, effective user adoption is by far the biggest risk to the long
term survival of the platform.</p>

<p><strong>3.Downloadable, printable copies of reports is important in a “paper based”
low digital literacy context like Sierra Leone</strong></p>

<p>Owing to the “paper based” culture that is prevalent across governmental
departments in developing countries, any system must allow for easy printing
of all reports generated by the users.</p>
