title: The Book of Why by Judea Pearl
excerpt: A primer on causal inference
---

This is a great primer on causal inference. Judea Pearl does a great job on highlighting
statistics' turbulent relationship with establishing causality instead of just insisting
on showing correlations between variables, and how recent advancements in causal
inference (including the wide-spread usage of causal diagrams) has moved the field towards
greater acceptance. The book is easy to follow for people needing an intro into
causal inference, and although there are times in the book where the explanation gets slightly
difficult to follow, overall its an engrossing read. I will definitely be referring to this book
in the future as I continue my learning in the data science space.
