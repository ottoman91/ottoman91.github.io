A standalone novel in the Cosmere universe, Warbreaker is a fast paced read.
It is set in the kingdom of Hallendren, where some mortals "Return" back after they have died. Nobody knows why some people return back from the dead, but a common understanding is that each of the Returned embody the purest form of a human trait. The Returned are worshipped and revered by the people of Hallandren, with each God commanding their own team of priests, armed guards and servants.
