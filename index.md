I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com//){:target="_blank"}.
My interests lie in using data science and human-centered design to create equitable outcomes.

I graduated from the [Design Impact](http://designimpact.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} program at Stanford, where I was mentored by [David Kelley](https://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley){:target="_blank"} on improving the transition of care process for pediatric patients at the Stanford Children's Hospital. You can read more about my thesis [here](http://www.thekiteproject.info/){:target="_blank"}.

At Stanford, I was a part of the [Data Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} (taught by Hadley Wickham, Chief Data Scientist at RStudio), where I gained extensive proficiency in using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){:target="_blank"} packages in R on close to 50 data science projects.

In a prior life,I worked in the information, communication and technology for development (ICTD) space in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone and Liberia on projects in the **healthcare**, **open government** and **financial
inclusion** sectors.
